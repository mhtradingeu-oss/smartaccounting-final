# SmartAccounting AI Governance & Compliance One-Pager (Final Draft)

## Core Principles
- No autonomous AI mutations: All AI actions are suggestions, never direct changes.
- Human-in-the-loop: Every AI-driven recommendation requires explicit human approval.
- Immutable audit trails: Every action, suggestion, and approval is logged and tamper-proof.
- Compliance by design: Built for GoBD, DATEV, ELSTER, and GDPR from day one.

## Legal & Regulatory Safety
- AI cannot cause legal or financial damage—humans always have final control.
- Transparent, auditable, and compliant with EU and German standards.
- Architecture prevents AI overreach and ensures future regulation readiness.

## Technical Guarantees
- AI is strictly read-only or suggestive—never autonomous in production.
- All data changes are auditable, immutable, and reversible by design.
- Security and compliance are core, not afterthoughts.
