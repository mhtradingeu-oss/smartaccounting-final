# DEPRECATED: See docs/ai_governance_compliance_onepager_final.md for canonical version.

This document is superseded by:

- docs/14_AI_ACCOUNTING_INTELLIGENCE_MASTER.md (AI architecture and guarantees)

Please refer to those documents for all current governance, compliance, and technical guarantees.

## What Makes SmartAccounting Unique

- Zero autonomous AI mutations: All AI actions are suggestions, never direct changes.
- Full human-in-the-loop: Every AI-driven recommendation requires explicit human approval.
- Immutable audit trails: Every action, suggestion, and approval is logged and tamper-proof.
- Compliance by design: Built for GoBD, DATEV, ELSTER, and GDPR from day one.

## Why This Matters

- Legal safety: AI cannot cause legal or financial damage—humans always have final control.
- Regulator trust: Transparent, auditable, and compliant with EU and German standards.
- Investor confidence: Architecture prevents AI overreach and ensures future regulation readiness.

## Key Guarantees

- AI is strictly read-only or suggestive—never autonomous in production.
- All data changes are auditable, immutable, and reversible by design.
- Security and compliance are core, not afterthoughts.
