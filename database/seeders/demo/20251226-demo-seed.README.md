# DEMO DATA SEEDER: Technical Summary

## What was added

- A safe, idempotent demo seeder at `database/seeders/demo/20251226-demo-seed.js`.
- Seeds:
  - One demo company (Demo Company)
  - Three users (admin, accountant, viewer)
  - Two demo invoices
  - Two demo expenses
  - One demo bank statement
- All data is only created if it does not already exist (idempotent).
- Seeder will not run in production unless `DEMO_MODE=true`.
- No existing production data is modified or deleted.
- Console logs describe each seeded item.

## How to run

1. Set environment variable: `DEMO_MODE=true`
2. Run:
   ```sh
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed database/seeders/demo/20251226-demo-seed.js
   ```

## Why it is safe

- Explicit guard: Will not run in production unless `DEMO_MODE=true`.
- Idempotent: Checks for existing records before inserting.
- Does not modify or delete any existing production data.
- Console logs for auditability.

**For investor/demo environments only. Never use in real production unless demo mode is explicitly enabled.**
